Hello, I am 29 years old and have no prior knowledge of coding or Bitcoin, but through Googling, the help of ChatGPT, and information from various websites, I have been able to create and modify a Bitcoin futures trading bot. I’ve developed an interest not only in strategies and trading techniques but also in coding and building programs. I’ve recently joined GitHub and would greatly appreciate any quality assistance and guidance.
